# Barbershop Scheduler (backup)

This is a group project for CPSC 312, 2021, UBC. \
We will create a customer scheduler for barber shops in Haskell language. The users will be able to choose their preferred barbers, their preferred date and time, or search for available slots.

# To run the scheduler
In Terminal, enter:\
        ghci\
        :load main\
        run


There are 2 available barbers in the application, \
you can enter "tom" or "tony" as your preferred barber, then choose your preferred date and time. 

We use real-time date data type, you can only enter a date on or after today. \
We assume the shop is closed on every Tuesday, you cannot enter a date that is on Tuesday.\
To test this, try enter the date "2021-03-09" which is a Tuesday.

If you enter a time that is unavailable, the program has 2 options to give you suggestions:
1. try to find the nearest available time in the chosen day, for the chosen barber
2. try to find other barber that is available at the chosen date and time
   
To test this, try enter the date "2021-11-11" or "2021-11-12", and choose barber "tom", then choose an occupied time in the schedule list to see what suggestions the program gives you. 

Enter "q" or "quit" to quit the program.
